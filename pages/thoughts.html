                <p>It's been 2 years since I haven't wrote on my dream journal, until today.</p>
                <p>I've been keeping this habit since I was a kid and I'm glad I got back to it today. I have a hard time having healthy and long dreams (or nightmares) if I don't sleep well so it helps building a good sleep habit as well. Today I thought I forgot about my dreams but as soon as I started writing, everything came back to me. I remembered that a dear person to me was with me in the dream and I felt at peace.</p>
                <p>Most of my early childhood dreams need a bit of time and effort to read because I wrote them in a bad writing since I was afraid my parents or someone else would read them, but I can still read those early fears I had.</p>
                <p>When finishing writing today's dream, I went back to read the last dream I wrote in 2023, only to be taken a bit by surprise. The last sentences were: <i>"Je suis resté longtemps à réfléchir à la mort, disparition et que rien ne me sauverait, j'avais peur du vide, de la dsiparit:scribble:. Il faisait jour clair, Je me suis reveillé."</i> So imagine how weird it would have been if I left it like this and didn't pick up my journal again :p</p>
                <p>I also have a 7 string guitar now ? I don't want to talk much about it before I can make use of it seriously tho.</p>

                <p>Yes so that film camera I got for 5€ in the flea market (praktica ltl) ? well its working !! I just loaded some new film photos on my website</p>
                <p>Feels that I'm also getting more and more disconnected from my work. I'm super grateful that I work in a passionate industry but I feel like I can't stay more than 3 years doing the same thing.</p>

                <p>I saved me website on the internet archive ! Feels weird and good to do so, you become a sort of immortal in the scenario where internet archive will continue to exist in the far far future. So in case I die, I'll live for a longer time on the net heh. It's still impressive that they let you save websites without login in or anything, you just go there and give them a link to be saved. They are super generous with file sizes as well, since I dumbed uncompressed messed up paintings and drawings. I've also read that neocities is moving away from HTTP with the internet archive call but honestly I'm too tired now to deep dive this subject :(</p>
                <p>I also went with a friend to a concert since his sister was playing in an orchestra and... turned out they needed someone in the front of house !! They needed someone to switch the background videos after each song and man I didn't even know the songs so we had to figure out a way to communicate with each other. I messed up a lil bit initially but the rest was overall smooth, I'm super grateful to have had that opportunity and the light and sound engineer were so nice :) !!</p>
                <p>I've been studying music theory and practicing guitar basics from scratch. I want to get better at composition so I found that the best combo is finding a good book and having an AI tutor (used Claude 3.7, might switch to Gemini 2.5) for follow up questions. I've been learning everything from first principles so its satisfying. I might share my notes in the future :) </p>
                <p>Otherwise I've just been keeping myself busy as always to fill I GUESS the loneliness as much as I can</p>
                <p>I think I've been pushing it a bit far lately and my brain feels like its going to explode so I'll try to take things easy now that my website is mostly finished</p>

                <p>Finally managed to setup APIs on nekoweb and neocities to streamline my updates. I think that from now on, I'll leave this thought section for actual thoughts and will leave the website updates to the rss feed. See you later cyber cowboy !</p>

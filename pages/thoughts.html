                <p>Just came back from a Deafheaven + Alcest concert. Deafheaven were magical, I crowdsurfed at the end on Winona and I got my tapes signed by Kerry, it was a cool night :)</p>

                <p>It's been a while since I haven't wrote in my journal, more than what I would like to at least.</p>
                <p>I've read a quote that goes like "Remember the hardship you went through 2 years ago and how you thought they were insurmountable. Yet here you are", but the more I think about it the more blurry my hardships of 2 years ago are, they sort of blend in the monotony of adulthood and the austerity of emotions. What was my biggest hardship of 2 years ago ? Well I don't know, sometimes I think that I'm still living through it, even though things are a bit better, but memories loose to vengeful time.</p>
                <p>So yeah, this is why I came back to write this, so that you reading this in the future don't forget the hardships of 2 years ago.</p>
                <p>And... A lot of things happened since the last time I wrote something here (big thoughts dump incoming):</p>
                <p>My 7 string broke the day after I bought it so my friend helped me solder it, I joined some friends in a shoegazy dream pop band to play bass, and I practice vocals as well (still need to also find a teacher just to start on good foundations), got back to dynamic sketching (not progressing as I should), met some new friends and I'm spending time trying to write music (it sucks mostly). Work is still boring me to death as always but at least I can focus on my hobbies. What else ? Still debating whether I start a medication with its potential lasting side-effects, still practicing Staos, started experimenting with a camera, got scammed money (not a lot so that's okey), hit a pause on music theory and I'm still waiting for my eink smartphone. My brother should also come to stay at my place for a little bit this summer so that should be nice, although my place is small af !! I'm also not sure if I'm going to taky any vacation this summer, I just don't know where to go lol. Yeah that V2 of my homepage will also wait i guess :(</p>
                <p>That's about it ! See ya next time cyber cowboy !</p>

                <p>Been enjoying my 7 string so far :) </p>
                <p>Still don't have a lot to show but I've I've been practicing Staos by Vildhjarta, corrected the tabs a bit (will upload them to songsterr later), doing good progress ! (those djent patterns are giving me headaches)</p>
                <p>Also tried to transpose Phobon Nika, managed to play part of its start in Drop F# but the rest is unplayable in a drop tuning. In any case, I just wanted to try the cleans of the guitar and they sound so good with Plini X !</p>
                <p>Also did the undoable ??? Rearranging Confiance by Mirar in Drop F# ! Would still need some pitch shift on the 6th mostly but its honesly doable !</p>
                <p>Been try-harding Veil of Maya and Currents for the past months and I felt that I wasn't progressing but I think I still improved given that I'm able to play all this stuff !</p>

                <p>It's been 2 years since I haven't wrote on my dream journal, until today.</p>
                <p>I've been keeping this habit since I was a kid and I'm glad I got back to it today. I have a hard time having healthy and long dreams (or nightmares) if I don't sleep well so it helps building a good sleep habit as well. Today I thought I forgot about my dreams but as soon as I started writing, everything came back to me. I remembered that a dear person to me was with me in the dream and I felt at peace.</p>
                <p>Most of my early childhood dreams need a bit of time and effort to read because I wrote them in a bad writing since I was afraid my parents or someone else would read them, but I can still read those early fears I had.</p>
                <p>When finishing writing today's dream, I went back to read the last dream I wrote in 2023, only to be taken a bit by surprise. The last sentences were: <i>"Je suis resté longtemps à réfléchir à la mort, disparition et que rien ne me sauverait, j'avais peur du vide, de la dsiparit:scribble:. Il faisait jour clair, Je me suis reveillé."</i> So imagine how weird it would have been if I left it like this and didn't pick up my journal again :p</p>
                <p>I also have a 7 string guitar now ? I don't want to talk much about it before I can make use of it seriously tho.</p>

                <p>Yes so that film camera I got for 5€ in the flea market (praktica ltl) ? well its working !! I just loaded some new film photos on my website</p>
                <p>Feels that I'm also getting more and more disconnected from my work. I'm super grateful that I work in a passionate industry but I feel like I can't stay more than 3 years doing the same thing.</p>

                <p>I saved me website on the internet archive ! Feels weird and good to do so, you become a sort of immortal in the scenario where internet archive will continue to exist in the far far future. So in case I die, I'll live for a longer time on the net heh. It's still impressive that they let you save websites without login in or anything, you just go there and give them a link to be saved. They are super generous with file sizes as well, since I dumbed uncompressed messed up paintings and drawings. I've also read that neocities is moving away from HTTP with the internet archive call but honestly I'm too tired now to deep dive this subject :(</p>
                <p>I also went with a friend to a concert since his sister was playing in an orchestra and... turned out they needed someone in the front of house !! They needed someone to switch the background videos after each song and man I didn't even know the songs so we had to figure out a way to communicate with each other. I messed up a lil bit initially but the rest was overall smooth, I'm super grateful to have had that opportunity and the light and sound engineer were so nice :) !!</p>
                <p>I've been studying music theory and practicing guitar basics from scratch. I want to get better at composition so I found that the best combo is finding a good book and having an AI tutor (used Claude 3.7, might switch to Gemini 2.5) for follow up questions. I've been learning everything from first principles so its satisfying. I might share my notes in the future :) </p>
                <p>Otherwise I've just been keeping myself busy as always to fill I GUESS the loneliness as much as I can</p>
                <p>I think I've been pushing it a bit far lately and my brain feels like its going to explode so I'll try to take things easy now that my website is mostly finished</p>

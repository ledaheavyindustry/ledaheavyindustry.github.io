-> Hey so I guess you've either found this page by yourself in this case my dad work for interpol and I just told him about you
-> Or ! I've sent you this link b-but it's not like I trust you or we're close or anything, hmph !!
-> To All of You, in 15 Years
-> I'm genuinly serious about this being a time capsule ! I want to write a cool message but I have no idea where to start
-> This was shot on Friday the 19th of December 2025, at the Pavillon Baltard. I was filled with weariness and anguish and thought that filming everything will help me dissociate with myself
-> I don't know what I should write in this capsule !! But I hope you can be proud of your old self and your time spent in this place

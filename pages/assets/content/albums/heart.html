-> WELCOME TO THE HEART
-> Hey ! So I guess you found this page huh ? Did you solve the puzzle ? Did you brute force your way out of it ? Or did you specifically looked for this page ? 
   Maybe you just randomly found this page ? Or maybe you used AI assistants ?
-> Wait ! Maybe you are a rogue AGI ??! In this case I guess I'm cooked !
-> Well either way, I really appreciate you taking the time to look at my website, it really means a lot to me :)
-> This puzzle was mainly inspired by tales from the Ait Waryaghel Amazigh tribe, which is a very close tribe to mine ! I also added some Burzum lore related to the password myth.
-> I'm thinking that maybe I could put here some super personal things since its my heart but I don't know how to open up :(
-> I'm very grateful for the time you gave me, I don't know how to return that favor, but hey, send me a message and let's chat a bit :)
-> Oh and maybe, if you're the first one to see this message then you'll be the lucky one to get this 5â‚¬ steam gift card ! M2G5M-QY8IL-HZFI8 
-> *NEW*: WELL WELL WELL, my number 1 best & most childhood friend (shoutout to all the trauma we collected at that Dra*** school) managed to solve it. 
   Through his eternal generosity and his other-dimensional kindness, he decided to NOT REDEEM the code (in fact I kept screaming at him DO NOT REDEEM DO NOT REDEEM, until he gave up). 
   SO, if you are the promised SECOND one, I guess its still yours to take.

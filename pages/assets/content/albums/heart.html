-> Hey ! So I guess you found this page huh ? Did you solve the puzzle ? Did you brute force your way out of it ? Or did you stumbled upon this page ?
-> Well either way, I really appreciate you taking the time to look at my website, it really means a lot to me :)
-> I'm thinking that maybe I could put here some super personal things since its my heart but I don't know how to open up !
-> I'm very grateful for the time you gave me, I don't know how to return that favor, but hey, send me a message and let's chat a bit :)
-> Oh and maybe, if you're the first one to see this message then you'll be the lucky one to get this 5â‚¬ steam gift card ! M2G5M-QY8IL-HZFI8
